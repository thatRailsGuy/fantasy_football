**Third:** Al

**First Place Regular Season:** Clint

**Highest Regular Season Points:** Shawn

**Highest Single Week Points:** Robert

**Rookie of the Cob:** (no rookies)

****Recap****

On a last ditch run to a championship with time running out, Shawn barely made the playoffs but rode on the backs of Jerrick McKinnon and Jalen Hurts to go out on top of the league. Robert finished runner-up, narrowly missing somebody cashing the bet on the sexy calendar. 

### 2021 Season

Emily joined the league!

**First:**  Brian

**Second:** Pat

**Third:** Jon

**First Place Regular Season:** Brian

****Recap****

Brian dominated from day one, scoring the most points, securing number one seed, and dominating his opponents in the playoffs. Al coasted on the remnants of Jen's team from last year to slide into second. Jillian score the highest total in championship week but it was too little too late. 

The bet between Clint and Robert was a push, although knocking Robert out of the playoffs in round one was satisfying.

#### 2018 Notes
- kicked out Molly
- Justin wussed out.

#### Week 1:
Clint slaughtered Daniel. Voldemort slaughtered Robert. Jen slaughtered Shawn. Cecils go undefeated.

#### Week 2:
Clint beats Voldemort to be the best Cecil. Jen continues consistently losing to Andrew.

#### Week 3:
Pat beats Clint to take over second place. Jon squeaks out a win over Jen.

#### Week 4:
Jillian kills Clint. Fantasy is bullshit.

#### Week 5:
Pat beats Voldemort by one point. Robert upsets Jen. 

#### Week 6:
Clint beats Jen so badly she considers quitting fantasy football. Jillian continues her winning streak despite having the eighth best score. 

#### Week 7:
Jen takes out her anger on Daniel, nearly doubling his score. He cries. Brian gets his lone win of the season over Voldemort.

#### Week 8: 
Nothing important happens.

#### Week 9:
Shawn beats Robert like he owes him money.

#### Week 10:
Clint beats Robert like he owes him money. I think Robert is a masochist. Jillian beats Jen in a sister showdown.

#### Week 11:
Shawn puts up 127 points but loses to Clint. Jen wastes a 143 point performance on Brian's team. 

#### Week 12:
Rodney overcomes Cocaine Seizures(Pat). Daniel takes advantage of injuries and the bye week to upset Clint. Jen beats Shawn to keep her playoff hopes alive. Jon hands Jillian her first loss of the season.

#### Week 13:
Jen, assisted by Andrew's sandbagging, puts herself in position to move into the final playoff spot but needs help from Daniel's team. Daniel falls flat. The Champ is dead. Pat squeaked out a win over Robert by 1.6 points to take the bye from Clint.

#### Week 14 (Playoff Round 1):
Clint and Andrew faceoff. Andrew shit the bed.

Jon and Shawn faceoff. Jon scored 142. too bad he scored 52 the next week.

Jillian and Pat enjoy a break. 

In the consolation bracket... nobody cares.

#### Week 15 (Semi-Final):
Jillian vs Jon: Jon's team let up from and scored 1/3 of their previous week's score.

Pat vs Clint: Clint's players decided to fuck him in the playoffs.

#### Week 16 (Championship):

#### Week 4:
down by 0.72 going into Monday Night with one player left against Robert, Justin relied on Chris Thompson to get 8 yards. Thompson, feeling the pressure of Justin's hopes and dreams, got 27 yards to put Justin up by 1.98, but fumbled in a lateral play on the last play of the game, losing two points and Justin's trust as Justin fell to Robert by 0.02 points. 

#### Week 6:
After being decimated by injuries, Clint fell to Jen, starting a three game skid.

#### Week 7:
Justin's kicker scored -1 and he lost by 0.3 points.

#### Week 10:
Clint changed his team name to droopy dogs and destroyed Robert's team 129.60 - 71.32. 

#### Week 11:
Jen, Andrew, and Clint locked themselves in to the playoffs. Molly, Rodney, and Shawn were eliminated from contention. 

#### Week 12:
Clint destroyed the hopes and dreams of Daniel once again. Jon edged out Amy Winehouse to all but assure a place in the playoffs. Shawn beat an unsuspecting Jen in the upset of the year. Between Shawn's great play and Daniel being terrible, this moved Clint into first place.

#### Week 14 (Playoff Round 1):
Clint and Jen enjoyed a married couple bye week. Daniel talked a lot of shit only to lose to Andrew. Jon beat Pat to move on to the next round. 

In the loser's bracket, Justin beat Molly who didn't set a lineup, Shawn embarassed Rodney. Robert and Voldemort had byes. 

#### Week 15 (Playoff Semifinals)
Clint faced Andrew in a battle of wits and stupidity. Wits won. Jen and Jon's matchup came down to the wire, with Jen needing 5 points from Freeman, who gave 25. Clint and Jen in the league's first (of many) husband-wife final. Keeping the money in the family.

In the loser's race, for the fifth place game Pat is nearly doubled Daniel's score. Rodney beat Molly to cement her role as (power) bottom of the league. Shawn is poured the coals to Voldemort. Robert beat Justin in an underwhelming 68-62 dud. Shawn and Robert battle next week for the title of "King of the Corn."

#### Week 16 (Finals)
Clint vs. Jen - Jen wins. Fuck Fantasy Football

Consolation Games:
Third: Jon vs Andrew - Andrew wins.

Consolation Championship (7th place): Shawn vs Robert - Shawn wins.



### 2016 Season
After dominating the regular season, Jen choked in the playoffs, getting upset by Rodney on his unlikely run to the championship where he would ultimately be knocked out by Justin. Voldemort beat Jen for third place.  TJ finished last, not setting his lineup all season and still almost beating Molly. Molly sent everybody her password, which inspired Robert's team name of "ThighBreaker17".

### 2015 Season
Proving that fantasy football is in fact "Bullshit", Molly took home an unlikely championship that nobody could have predicted. Runner up was Andrtew, followed by Jon. Juan took last place by setting his lineup only once every few weeks. Molly posted a picture with her vibrator in the background, inspiring Robert's "Blue Buzzers".

### 2014 Season
On Fleaflicker so history of it is sparse. Voldemort beat Robert in the final. Clint took third place. Rodney was in last, where he belongs.
