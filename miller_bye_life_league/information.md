# Miller Bye Life FFB League Rules

Please read all rules carefully and keep this Google Doc in a handy place to answer any questions you may have during the season. It will also be pinned to the ‘League Chat’.  

This is a live document and will be edited (by the commissioner) as things come up. These alterations will be 
`highlighted`
as they are made.

## League Communication

All draft/trade communication will be done through the Sleeper platform. 

**TURN ON YOUR SLEEPER NOTIFICATIONS.**
This is twofold - first, if someone reaches out with a proposed trade, this is how you will see it (just like in Yahoo or ESPN, there is a 'trade proposal' button). And obviously timing is of the essence in this scenario. Also, if you aren't targeting one specific person but want to just start a dialogue with the group about someone who is willing to trade, the chat function there (which we need to use) will be important - you can also pick a handful of people to have a 'group chat' with as well. You will also get league notifications from the ‘League Chat’ this way as well.  

> Out of respect for your leaguemates, please respond to any trade requests/messages on the Sleeper platform within 48 hours of receiving a notification to keep the communication flowing.

## Entry Fee

$50 per player per season - following years payments will be made before rookie draft. 

We’ll be using Leaguesafe from here on out. 

## Payout

- 1st place: $300
- 2nd place: $150
- 3rd place: $50

## Number of Teams

10

## Waivers

> Each manager will have $100 FAAB TOTAL (by way of blind bidding ‘dollars’) for the entire offseason/season COMBINED (this began January 2023). This $100 will refresh at the beginning of each offseason, thereafter.

### Off-Season Waivers

There will be waivers that clear overnight on Wednesdays and Saturdays for the 2023 offseason. There will be no ‘free agent’ pickups outside of these waiver claim periods in the offseason. 

### In-Season Waivers

Weekly waiver processing period until ‘Tuesday after midnight PST’ (Sunday at start of games until Tuesday after midnight PST).

Players are ‘free agents’ after the processing period ends and are ‘first come, first serve’ until games lock players again on Sunday (then the Sunday-Tuesday after midnight PST waiver processing period begins again) 

## Schedule

### Regular Season

14 week regular season (head-to-head matchups)

### Playoffs

Playoffs run Week 15, 16, and 17; Top 6 teams advance; 1st and 2nd seeds get a bye in first week and 3rd vs 6th/4th vs 5th; reseeding for later rounds

> The bottom four teams will compete in the Consolation Bracket Tournament in Weeks 15 and 16. The winner will receive an extra $20 in their FAAB the following season. 

## Rookie Draft

Each proceeding season’s draft will consist only of rookie players coming out of college in the year the draft is being completed (Example: for the 2023 season, rookies that entered the league through the 2023 NFL Draft will be eligible to be chosen during that year’s Dynasty Rookie Draft). 

The date of these drafts each year will be determined at a later date, but will be completed after the actual NFL Draft and before the NFL Regular Season commences.

Each Rookie Draft will be 5 rounds. 

This will be a ‘Slow Draft’ with a 24 hour pick timer for Rounds 1, 2, and 3, and a 12 hour pick timer for Rounds 4 and 5. There will be no overnight pauses in the rookie draft.  

### Rookie Draft Order

Draft Order of Bottom 4 Teams: The draft order of the four teams that don’t make the playoffs will be calculated by the ‘MAX PF’ (Maximum Points For or ‘optimal lineup’ situation) for the entire duration of the regular fantasy season (Weeks 1-14). Sleeper has a spot on their app that shows the total amount of points that a team could have scored throughout the entire season if they had their optimal lineup in place each week (aka MAX PF). These points are calculated for the entire roster and the ‘optimal lineup’ is selected for the calculation (similar to ‘best ball leagues’) automatically by Sleeper. The only information shown by Sleeper is the total MAX PF for a manager’s team throughout the entire season and this is how draft order for these four teams will be calculated. The team with the fewest potential points (MAX PF) over the course of those fourteen weeks out of these four non-playoff teams gets the first pick, eliminating the benefit for an owner of benching their best players/tanking. The second fewest MAX PF gets the second pick, etc. 

Draft Order of Top 6 Teams: The teams with the best 6 records will draft at the end of the rookie draft. 

League winner: Drafts last in the upcoming rookie draft

League runner-up: Drafts second to last in the upcoming draft

Remaining 4 playoff teams that are eliminated: Once a team (out of these top 6) is eliminated (two teams will be eliminated each week), they will be ranked based on their regular season finish, with the worser-ranked team of the two teams (during the regular season) having the higher pick. 

Example: Let’s say the 3rd and 5th seeds lose their respective first-round playoff matchups (3rd place loses to 6th place and 5th place loses to 4th place). The 5th place team (their rank at the end of the regular season) would get the fifth pick in the draft, and the 3rd place team would get the sixth pick in the draft (just as you would see in the actual NFL draft order of eliminated playoff teams). 


## Rosters

Final Roster: 1-QB/2-RB/3-WR/1-TE/3-FLEX/1-SUPERFLEX/20-BEN/3-IR/3-TXSQ (31 active players plus 3 taxi spots and 3 IR spots)

Each team must cut-down their rosters to 31 players before the start of the season. Everyone has a different number of players they will have to address (draft picks, players coming off the taxi squad from last season, free agent pickups, etc.), to get your roster back down to 31 before the start of the regular season, or you will not be able to set lineups/make moves (aka you lose games/draft picks because of incomplete lineups).

### Taxi Squad Players

Prior to the start of the first regular season game, each team will have the opportunity to use their 3 taxi squad spots. These are slots where managers can keep players with less than 1 year of experience (aka, a rookie) and they won’t count towards their active roster. Along with this, taxi squad players from last season must be promoted to the active roster/waived as they are no longer eligible for the taxi squad. 

Deadline: By kickoff of the Thursday night season opener on SEPTEMBER 7, 2023, taxi squad slots will be LOCKED and no player will be able to be added to these slots for the duration of the season after this locking occurs.

If you don’t add your players into these slots before this deadline, you won’t have any taxi squad players for the 2023 season. 

A player in a taxi squad is able to be brought up to the active roster at any point during the regular season, but just like an IR slot, an active player on the 27-player roster needs to be waived to make room for this first. 

Once a player is removed from a taxi squad, no additional players can be added to the taxi squad for the duration of the 2023 season. (Example: if Team A starts with 3 taxi squad players and moves two up to the active roster, they are not able to have any additional adds to their taxi squad until after the 2024 rookie draft. Their taxi squad will only consist of 1 taxi squad player until that time). 

Once a player leaves a taxi squad they are not able to be put back on, no matter their league experience - ever. 

## Trades

### Trade Deadline

The trade deadline is up to and including the Week 14 games. As soon as the league playoff has ended, trading will reopen.

### General Information

Trading of players and future draft picks are allowed at all times (except during the deadline-to-playoff window as stated in the previous statement). There will be a 24 hour ‘pending’ period for league members to evaluate said trade to ensure no collusion. If anyone believes a trade smells of collusion, it will be brought to the attention of the commissioner. Per the commissioner’s evaluation, the trade can either stand/be rejected/go to a league vote to determine the final outcome of said trade. However, if you ‘don’t like a trade’ but there is nothing ‘fishy’ going on with said trade, tough shit. Managers will be able to manage their team however they deem fit and there will be no vetoes. Assessing value in dynasty is one of the most thrilling parts of the game and will not be limited based on differences of opinion. Collusion is the only issue to be on alert about as this will not be tolerated. 

### Trading Future Draft Picks

Future draft picks can only be traded two years out. Example: for the current 2023 year, a manager can only obtain draft capital as far out as the 2025 draft (not the 2026 one). NOTE: 2026 picks will automatically show up on your roster on Sleeper but will not be in play until the offseason begins for the 2024 season. 
> (If you trade a following years draft pick you will be required to pay that years league dues by time trade is processed.)

### Taxi Squad Players

If a player on a team’s taxi squad is traded to another team, that player is NOT able to go on the new team’s taxi squad; they have to be entered into the new team’s 27-player roster. The team getting rid of the taxi squad player will also not be able to replace this player on the taxi squad. 

If taxi squad players are swapped in a trade, NEITHER are allowed on the new team’s taxi squads, but instead are to be on the new team’s 27-player roster. 

Poaching taxi squad players is not allowed. 

## Commissioner Help

> This section is here to discuss what types of things I can help you with if it is needed during the season.

Everyone is more than welcome (and encouraged) to communicate with me directly PRIOR TO A GAME if there is a lineup problem/roster question during the season. The penalties for not setting lineups are there to ensure the integrity of the seriousness of the league, but obviously if I can help with this, I will. 

If there is ANYTHING you are questioning (Your QB1 is questionable that starts on Sunday night and you’re trying to decide what to do with your lineup, for example); you conversing with me directly before the week starts and us coming up with a good plan of action is enough to ensure you don’t get an ‘Incomplete Lineup Penalty’. So essentially, just talk to me. That’s it. That ensures me you aren’t trying to be deceitful (tank) or lacking ‘care’ for the league. The penalties are there to ensure people aren’t purposely tanking/not setting their lineups, and they are there to ensure you actually give a shit about the league and you are doing what you can to have a complete lineup each week - not just forgetting about the league. Sometimes things are not black and white so talking to me BEFOREHAND is the solution.  

Remember: not setting a lineup doesn’t only affect your draft position, but it affects the rest of the standings as well. 

Another example of a good time to reach out to me: if you know you will not have internet service before the game Sunday and you have a RB that is questionable in your lineup on Saturday night, you can preemptively let me know who you would want to swap in that position if the player is ruled out and I am happy to do that for you (assuming I’m available) so you won’t end up losing a draft pick for not setting a complete lineup. ‘Hoping for the best’ in this situation can easily hurt you (and you wouldn’t be doing that if you were making a championship run, but more likely to do if it helps your draft selection the following year) and if that player didn’t end up playing, not only did you have a zero in that spot, but you were penalized for an incomplete lineup as well. Also - if you have no interest in getting help from me - you can obviously be on the safe side and put the backup player in instead; then you are at least not jeopardizing your future by losing draft picks from an ‘Incomplete Lineup Penalty’. 

I may not always be available, but chances are, I can do a quick swap for anyone if it is impossible for you all to do so based on a specific circumstance like this. 

Point is: if something seems ‘not doable’ due to a special circumstance, come to me with questions beforehand instead of after the fact to ensure the best outcome for your squad. I can only work with the information that I have presented to me and will keep it fair for the others in the league. If I’m not alerted beforehand of ANY type of reason for not having a complete lineup set (outside of an emergency), the ‘Incomplete Lineup Penalty’ will be issued.

These ‘Incomplete Lineup Penalties’ are in place (and strict) because this is an important hobby for all of us and a long-term investment that can be messed up quickly by carelessness. This can be easily avoided with open, proactive communication so let me know if there are questions going into a week about anything at all and I’ll do my best to help. 

## Incomplete Lineup Penalties

If a team doesn’t set a lineup in a given week, this is not ok. I know people get busy or might forget, but this is a long-term investment that affects the outcomes of others as well. So a simple lineup setting should be the least of your worries in a year-round commitment such as this. If a lineup isn’t set, consequences will be had.

> If there is any type of a life emergency, you will OBVIOUSLY not be punished for that. I’m not a heartless dick. The situation will be addressed differently and I’ll reach out individually if something of this nature were to happen. 

> There are also some situations that people may just not have another option - injuries/bye weeks/etc and you don’t want to get rid of your bench players just to pick someone up for a week. This will be ruled upon the commissioner’s discretion. In turn, this may or may not be a  penalized situation (READ: but it absolutely can be penalized based on the sole discretion of the commissioner). Typically, not having enough players for a position isn’t the case since the bench sizes are so large that you’ll have multiple options. HOWEVER: with a situation of this nature, I need to be made aware of this BEFOREHAND (before the week begins). If I am finding out that you didn’t have a complete roster AFTER the games start for the week and you happen to bring something of this nature up as a reasoning, you will be penalized, no questions asked. Again - the common theme here - just let me know beforehand that this is something you are contemplating/having an issue with and we’ll figure out a solution together.

### First-time offense for not setting a lineup

Potential conversation with commissioner to clarify if this was done out of necessity/if there was a life emergency. If this isn’t the case, or if the commissioner can’t get in touch/an explanation out of said manager within 48 hours, the team in question will lose their 3rd-round draft pick for the following season. If a team does not have their 3rd-round pick for the following season, then they will lose their next available 3rd-round pick. If no 3rd-round picks are available, the first available 2nd-round pick will be taken. If no 2nd-round picks are available, the first available 1st-round pick will be taken (even if it is not ‘tradable’ yet).

### Second-time offense for not setting a lineup

Potential conversation with commissioner to clarify if this was done out of necessity. If this isn’t the case, or if the commissioner can’t get in touch/an explanation out of said manager within 48 hours, the team in question will lose HALF of their FAAB and their 2nd-round draft pick for the following season if this second-time offense happens in the same season. If a team does not have their 2nd-round pick for the following season, then they will lose their next available 2nd-round pick. If no 2nd-round picks are available, the first available 1st-round pick will be taken (even if it is not ‘tradable’ yet). A conversation with the commissioner and - if deemed probable - any committee members is also probable to determine if this pattern of behavior will subside. 

However, if this is a team’s second offense but in a separate season from the first offense, they will only lose their 3rd-round draft pick from the following season (or if that one isn’t available, their next available 3rd-round pick). If no 3rd round picks are available, their first available 2nd round pick, or if none are available, their first available 1st-round pick, even if it’s not ‘tradable’ yet, will be taken.

### Third-time offense for not setting a lineup

If all 3 offenses occur in the same season, a team is subjected for removal if deemed appropriate by the commissioner. If it is determined the team will stay, they will lose their first available 1st-round and 2nd-round draft pick (one of each) even if they are in different seasons, and they will lose 75% of their FAAB for the next available season that FAAB wasn’t taken from already. If this is the second time in the same season, but has previously forgotten to set a lineup in a season prior (totaling 3 offenses), a team will lose 50% of their FAAB and their first available 1st-round pick (even if it’s not ‘tradable’ yet).

If this is the third time an offense occurs, but all of the offenses occurred in three separate seasons, a team will lose their 2nd-round draft pick for the following season (or if not available, their first available 2nd-round pick; and if no 2nd-round picks are available, their first available 1st-round pick, even if it's not ‘tradable’ yet).

**A conversation deciding if said team should give up their team during the offseason and if dynasty isn’t the right space for them is acceptable for any 3-time offender within a 3-season span. 

After 3 seasons, the ‘offenses’ reset. 

There are no penalties for trading away players/draft picks at any time prior to the trade deadline. As long as managers are active, this is what is important. If they feel they are one of the bottom teams and they’d rather accumulate draft picks and trade away players, this is 100% acceptable.  

## Tanking

There will be no official rule against ‘tanking’ BUT the following conditions must be met each week:

- Managers CANNOT leave any empty spots on their roster
- Managers may not start any player that is OUT, on a bye week, or inactive on game day for any reason. 
- QBs must be the projected starter for their team
- No ‘special teams only’ players (i.e., you can’t start Matthew Slater at WR). 

If any of these situations occur, the ‘Incomplete Lineup Penalties’ will be assessed to the team in question.

The way the rookie draft and MAX PF calculations are setup will help alleviate overall tanking as well.

Tanking may be new to some, or it may be extremely against your fantasy football belief system. However, it is still a strategy that can be implemented in long-term fantasy sports. BUT the rules that are put into place will prevent this (MAX PF season-long calculation, incomplete lineup penalties, etc.) from completely upending the work of others and it will prevent a team from doing this in an unrealistic manner/have a high probability of limiting their success with it. 

There are two reasons this ‘version’ of tanking is allowed: 

- It is a strategy that, with the proper rules/regulations surrounding it (as so), some people prefer to have out there as an option. A team can (at best) get in the bottom four, but outside of that, they have no control of where they finish a season, as the MAX PF takes care of that. Also, with starting active player requirements, this can limit full-on ‘tanking’ from occurring as well.
- It takes away the ‘decision making’ process surrounding this sensitive topic. If the power was solely in my hands to decide (as commissioner) if someone was tanking (which can be done very subtly or very obviously), this can create a LOT more controversy of me having ‘too much power/opinion’ in something that technically can’t be proven if its a close call. The majority of league members expressed they felt this way when the league started, and still do, regarding the way this issue should be handled, so this is how it will continue to be set up moving forward.

Anyone that decides to drop ‘good’ players will be potentially (but more than likely) removed from the league at the discretion of the commissioner. This is tanking, quitting, and potentially even collusion combined into one and is FORBIDDEN (and pointless if you have a long-term interest in the league). If you lose interest in the league, reach out and we can find a solution; don’t destroy the integrity of the league just because you are no longer interested. 

The commissioner may return any dropped players to the roster they were dropped from if the decision to remove the manager happens in a timely manner and it is deemed (by the commissioner) in the best interest of the league (even if that means taking players from a manager who picked them up off of waivers).  

FINAL TAKEAWAY: Because of the inability to include all possible scenarios within these rules, the commissioner will also assume the governing position for the league. If any rule violations,  issues, ambiguities, loopholes or other problems come up, the commissioner will address the issue to the league, seek their input if he deems necessary, and then determine the best course of action. The commissioner has the final say in how rulings will be implemented for any specific situation. 

Also: I’ve spent months creating, editing, updating as our league evolves, seeking input from you all as well as countless others who have had years of dynasty experience, and have overthought many scenarios regarding this doc - all to ensure this is fun and fair for all. If you have any questions/qualms about anything, I probably have already exhaustedly thought over it and what will/won’t work. I’m happy to explain my reasonings - just ask :)
