# Miller Bye Life FFB League Rules

Please read all rules carefully and keep this Google Doc in a handy place to answer any questions you may have during the season. It will also be pinned to the ‘League Chat’.  

This is a live document and will be edited (by the commissioner) as things come up. These alterations will be 
`highlighted`
as they are made.

## League Communication

All draft/trade communication will be done through the Sleeper platform. 

**TURN ON YOUR SLEEPER NOTIFICATIONS.**
This is twofold - first, if someone reaches out with a proposed trade, this is how you will see it (just like in Yahoo or ESPN, there is a 'trade proposal' button). And obviously timing is of the essence in this scenario. Also, if you aren't targeting one specific person but want to just start a dialogue with the group about someone who is willing to trade, the chat function there (which we need to use) will be important - you can also pick a handful of people to have a 'group chat' with as well. You will also get league notifications from the ‘League Chat’ this way as well.  

> Out of respect for your leaguemates, please respond to any trade requests/messages on the Sleeper platform within 48 hours of receiving a notification to keep the communication flowing.

## Entry Fee

$50 per player per season - following years payments will be made before rookie draft. 

We’ll be using Leaguesafe from here on out.

## Waivers

> Each manager will have $100 FAAB TOTAL (by way of blind bidding ‘dollars’) for the entire offseason/season COMBINED (this began January 2023). This $100 will refresh at the beginning of each offseason, thereafter.

### Off-Season Waivers

There will be waivers that clear overnight on Wednesdays and Saturdays for the 2023 offseason. There will be no ‘free agent’ pickups outside of these waiver claim periods in the offseason. 

### In-Season Waivers

Weekly waiver processing period until ‘Tuesday after midnight PST’ (Sunday at start of games until Tuesday after midnight PST).

Players are ‘free agents’ after the processing period ends and are ‘first come, first serve’ until games lock players again on Sunday (then the Sunday-Tuesday after midnight PST waiver processing period begins again)
